The code and database for paper: "Scale-Invariant Structure Saliency selection for Fast Image Fuison".

The code is implemented by C++ along with the opencv library in the file "MakeCellFusion".

The database contains four kinds of images:

1) The database with the multi-focus cell images collected by ourselves, it is captured through adjusting the y-axle of the microscope to focus on different regions with the same scene. The database is composed by 15 groups of images and each group is arranged with a series of multi-focus color images with the same size of 2040x1086 or 2448x2048, ect. 
2) The multi-modal image database, it is composed by 8 pairs of gray multi-modal images. 
3) The natural multi-focus image database, it is organized by 15 pairs of multi-focus gray or color images. 
4) The Visible-infrared image database, it is composed by 8 pairs of gray visible-infrared images.
